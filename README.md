# `gatsby-theme-xdmorgan`

⚠️ Intended to be a drop-in solution for personal use and an experiment in providing a full-project toolkit using the Gatsby Theme workflow. Work in progress, docs soon&hellip; maybe.

## Theme Docs

See [gatsby-theme-xdmorgan/README.md](gatsby-theme-xdmorgan/README.md)

## Example Docs

See [example/README.md](example/README.md)

## TODO

- [ ] Look into copying necessary config files and/or modifying downstream package.json directly to include the necessary scripts
- [ ] Pass-through flags to gtxdm jest and eslint (rename from test/lint)
